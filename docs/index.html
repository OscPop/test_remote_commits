<h1>Trying out remote commits</h1>
<p>This repo has been made with the intent to try out different git and github features.</p>
  <p>I have been focusing on getting used to syncing work between the local machine and the remote repo.
    <br>Commands that I have used are:</br>
  <l>add, commit, push, pull, fetch, reset, remove</l>
  </p>
